## Tax Calculation Application

Howdy! Welcome to the Tax Calculation Application, where we crunch the numbers so you don't have to!

### Tax Calculation Formula

Here's the scoop on how we calculate your taxes:

- If your income is less than 8 Lakhs, you're in the clear! No tax for you.
- If your income exceeds 8 Lakhs, we apply the following tax rates:
  - If you're under 40, we'll take a 30% cut.
  - If you're between 40 and 60, it's a bit steeper at 40%.
  - If you're 60 or older, we'll only take 10%.

### How to Use

1. **Pick Your Age Group**: 
   - Choose your age group from the dropdown: `<40`, `≥ 40 & < 60`, or `≥ 60`.
   - Don't forget! This field is required, so make sure to select an option.

2. Errors?**: 
   - See any red exclamation marks? That means there's an error in the input field. Just hover over it to see what's wrong.

3. **Ready, Set, Submit**: 
   - Hit the "Submit" button to work your magic.
   - ! A modal will pop up with your calculated tax amount based on your inputs.
